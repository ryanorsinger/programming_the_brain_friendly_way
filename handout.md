## Proper Care and Feeding of Your Brain

### The brain's automatic and unhelpful default settings

- Prioritizes the urgent at the expense of the important
- Overemphasizes the negative over the positive
- Craves novelty. And distractions feel both novel and urgent

### Program or be programmed

- The world's most powerful corporations are focusing massive amounts of resources on finding ways to distract you. They call it "user engagement". "Engagement" means tricking you into losing focus on what's important to you to focus on *what's important to them*.
- Some of the greatest minds from analytical marketing, neuroscience, psychology, software engineering and data science are all working to create brilliant and novel ways to interrupt your focus. 
- Some of the world's most sophisticated and powerful machine learning algorithms are learning every day how to distract you more effectively.
- One of the best things you can do for your learning is to reduce the noise in your life. Disable as many notifications as possible. If someone important in your life needs you and it's super important, they'll call or text. When it's focus time, LinkedIn and Slack notifications can go fly a kite!

### Refocusing after interruption isn't linear

### Active Learning vs. Passive Learning

- Get off the bleachers and into the game

- Practice beats study for creating new connections between neurons

### Consistency Beats Intensity

- It's how the brain works.
- Sleeping 8 hours late on Saturday doesn't make up for shorting yourself an hour every weeknight
- Practicing 45 minutes a day beats "I'll study 10 hours on Sunday"
    1. Because it never happens
    2. Because daily investment is how the brain builds the most dense clusters of connections between neurons.
- Getting 1% better every day (stretching) vs. 1% worse every day (atrophy)
  - 1% better per day => 1.01<sup>365</sup> => 37.78 which is a 3778% gain! Turn $1.01 into $37.78.
  - 1% worse every day  =>  0.99<sup>365</sup> => atrophy down to 0.025%. Turns $0.99 to $0.02.
- What you do every day communicates to your subconscious what's super important and critical





### Your Comfort Zone is Quicksand

- Too far inside inside your Comfort Zone is quicksand.
- Too far outside your Comfort Zone is not sustainable.
- That's why super ambitious diets and workout plans fail. They're not digestible.
- Consistently aim for 5%-10% outside your comfort zone in the stretch zone.

### Brain Health

- Your brain is most likely dehydrated, continually distracted, and sleep deprived. These are established torture techniques used to break people. *Cease torturing yourself!*

- Stress is both good and bad. Too much stress (dis-stress) inhibits cognition and memory formation/retention/retreival. Other stress (eustress) lights a fire under your butt and you get things done. Lean into the good stress. Ghost the bad stress.

### Closing Thoughts

- Nobody knows everything. Everybody knows everything. By working together, we can do anything!

- Move off the step-by-step Lego instructions to become a Master Builder!

## Recommendations and Take-Aways

- Nourish your brain with sleep, hydration, and rest. It pays off with **real results**.
- Ghost your notifications. Turn off "engagement" in order to **tune in** to your own goals.
- Be clear that consistency is **easier** and pays off **exponentially**.
- Stoke the fires of learning with **90% practice and 10% study**.
