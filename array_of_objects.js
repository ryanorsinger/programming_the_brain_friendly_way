// How would we determine how many types of items are in the cart? What if there are more than we can reasonably, manually count?

// Write the code necessary to access the number of apples

// Write the code necessary to determine how much we spent on kiwis, in total

// Write the code to sum up the quantity of all items in the cart

// Write the code necessary to update the cost of each fruit to be 30% more.

// Write the code necessary to determine the average cost per item. Add price*quantity for each item together then divide by the total number.

// Write the code necessary to convert each item's price property into a string with a dollar sign like "$1.50"

// Write the code necessary to capitalize the first letter of each item's name property.
