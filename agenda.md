# Programming the Brain Friendly Way

## Thought for the Day
var quote = "Mathematics, you see, is not a spectator sport. 
    To understand mathematics means to be able to do mathematics. 
        And what does it mean to be doing mathematics? 
            In the first place, it means to be able to solve mathematical problems.
                - George Pólya"

quote = quote.replace("Mathematics", "Programming")
             .replace("mathematical", "programming")
             .replace(/mathematics/g, 'programming')
             .replace("George Pólya", "Ryan Orsinger")

console.log(quote);
